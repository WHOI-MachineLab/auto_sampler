# CAD File Descriptions

###### <OpenSEAS_housing.step>
3D-printed underwater housing for the pump, servo gearbox, 10-position valve, and electronics. Includes individual components for the main housing body and the bulkhead. Requires three O-rings: one radial-rod seal at the valve surface and two radial-piston seals at the bulkhead. Sizing for O-rings are included in the Datasheets directory.

###### <OpenSEAS_gear-mount-hardware.step>
3D-printed mounting hardward for attaching the gearbox to the underwater housing.

###### Components/<goBILDA_Stingray-4.STEP.zip>
Preconfigured servo motor and gear box for rotation of the valve mechanism, obtained from [ServoCity] (https://www.servocity.com/stingray-4-servo-gearbox-0-68-sec-60-15-rpm-1400-oz-in-torque-450-rotation/). Note, this file is stored as a compressed .zip file because the original .STEP file is too large to upload to GitHub.

###### Components/<goBILDA_D-bore-hub.STEP>
1/4 inch D-bore shaft adapter for connecting the gear box to the 10-position valve shaft, obtained from [ServoCity] (https://www.servocity.com/1309-series-sonic-hub-1-4-d-bore/). This component is attached to the gear box with four screws, before mounting to the valve shaft. Care should be taken to ensure there is enough clearance between these mounting screws and the valve mounting screws during operation. 

###### Components/<Sykam _S-6151.STEP>
10 position HPLC valve (Model: Sykam S 6151) for selecting the desire sample bag port, obtained from [Sykam] (https://sykam.com/product/valves/s-6151-hplc-valve/).
